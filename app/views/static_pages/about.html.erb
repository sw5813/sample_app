<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>
	Our world is far from perfect, with people throughout the globe facing issues ranging from climate change to poverty, and everything in between. Although experts have devoted countless resources to tackling such problems, solutions remain elusive. While these experts often have multiple degrees and years of experience in their field, years of specialized training may cause them to lose their creative edge and overlook simple solutions.  Sometimes, the biotech genius could learn something from the kid in Bio 101, or the World Bank economist could benefit from hearing the perspective of a student in introductory microeconomics.  The solution?  Start an online, collaborative think tank specifically for college students.  While there are currently hundreds of think tanks in the US, the majority of them focus heavily on published research, and none of them are specifically targeted to college students in an online, discussion-based environment.  This think tank will consist of many topics, initially starting with two - say, poverty and the economy.  Within each topic, a series of problems/predicaments will be presented (for example, what’s the most efficient way to make sure every poor child in Africa has a malaria net?), and a student may provide a possible solution to the problem by simply “posting” his or her idea, that way the people who don’t want to put the time/effort into writing an official paper, getting it published, etc., can still share their ideas and thoughts with the world.  Each post will initially be limited to 99 words, requiring the responses to be concise and to-the-point, fostering a productive and conducive environment.  However, professors and experts (who will be recruited to participate in the site) will be able to “thumbs up” a post.  If a post receives a thumbs up, the student will be provided additional wordage to further his or her thoughts.  Each topic will have a moderator, and the moderator will read over all the responses received, making sure only legitimate ones are posted to the site.  The site will first start with students at Yale and Harvard (only these students can post, but the public can view), thus making it easier to get the public’s attention - people will be curious as to what some of the (objectively speaking) smartest college students in the world think are the solutions to our most pressing problems.  The site will eventually be opened to many more colleges once it starts to get more clout, and then the goal is to have the site grab the attention of organizations like the UN and Google, so that the students who come up with the best ideas can be put in touch with and collaborate with these organizations in order to implement their solutions to the world’s most pressing problems.
